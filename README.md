# CNN_Downsampler
A reinforcement learning agent which uses a CNN policy network to effectively downsample observations. 

This repo was made to compliment the original [Bayes-Swarm](http://adams.eng.buffalo.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ghassemi_JCISE-19-1275.pdf) algorithm. The Bayes-Swarm repository I worked in is private, so I'm putting the contribution here since it is a separate environment.
